Rando is a minimalist generator of random strings, numbers and so on to help reduce some monotony particularly while writing automated tests or anywhere else you need anything random

## Usage
Rando is available on composer under the `samshal/rando` alias.

## Project Roadmap
The goal of the Rando library is to be a complete, intelligent randomization tool for generating _truely_ random things. This includes stuff like generating random *sentences with positive/neutral/negative sentiments directly from public streams of information such as twitter*, down to the even more complex ones such as *random person _objects_ with several properties such as age, date of birth, phone numbers, first/lastnames and so on*

> This Project is developed and maintained by Samuel Adeshina.
> These days I rarely get enough time so the development of this library *will* move really really (progressively) slow. Although, I'm going to continuously add new features infrequently, issues resolution shall not be affected. Pull requests are highly welcome.
